Java 
----------

    .java ----> java compiler -----------------------> .class 
                converts your javacode into ByteCode


    - ByteCode is understandable only to JVM

    JVM - Java Virtual Machine 
        - responsible to execute the bytecode on the given platform 

    JRE - Java Runtime Environment
        - JVM + standard libraries 

    JDK - Java Development Kit 
        - JRE + development tools i.e. javac, jar, etc.

        4. Data types, operators in java 

========================


    Java is a object oriented programming language 




    - Variables in java 
        - store values 

        1. Local Variables 
                - declared inside a method, constructor  
                - don't have default values, must be initialized before its use 
                - memory for all the local variables will be allocated when the method is invoked, and the detroyed when the method finishes its execution 


        2. Instance Variables 
                - declared inside a class, (outside methods)
                - whenever a new object is created (using 'new' keyword), memory for all the instance 
                    variables will be allocated, destroyed when the object is deleted 
                - instance variables have default values 
                    - i.e. for numbers = 0
                        for booleans = false 
                        for reference types = null 
                - we can use the access modifiers i.e. public, private, protected, default 

                        - defualt - the members will be accessible anywhere within the same 'package'
                        - public - accessible everywhere 
                        - private - accessible only within the class 
                        - protected - accessible only within the class and the subclass 

        3. Static Variables 
                - declared inside a class, using the 'static' keyword
                - only 1 copy of static variable will be allocated per class 
                - when the class is loaded, memory for static variables will be allocated 
                - define the accessiblity using the modifiers i.e. public, private, protected 


Garbadge Collection 
    - removes the unreferenced objects from the memory 


    static keyword 
        - static variables 

        - static methods 

        - static class 

    final keyword 
        - final variables
            - a final variable is constant variables, once the value is assigned you cannot change it  

        - final methods 
            - a final method cannot be overridden in its subclass 

        - final class 
            - a final class cannot be subclassed 


    Java Keyboard inputs 
    ------------------------

            1. using Scanner class 

            2. using IO classes 

            3. using Console class 



    Data types 
    ----------------
        primitive data types 
            - hold / represent values directly 

                byte        1 byte              -128 to 127

                short       2 bytes             ..

                int         4 bytes             ..

                long        8 bytes 

                float       4 bytes 

                double      8 bytes 

                char        1 byte 

                boolean     1 bit

        Refernece types 
            - all the class, interface, enums type variables are called reference types 
            - stores ref to the memory 

                String str; 
                Employee employee;


        Wrapper classes 
        --------------------
            - for each primitive type i.e. int, char etc. there is a corresponding reference type available i.e. Integer, Character 


                    byte                Byte 
                    short               Short 
                    int                 Integer 
                    long                Long 
                    float               Float 
                    double              Double 
                    char                Character 
                    boolean             Boolean 

            - wrapper classes provide various methods to perform typecasting, and a few operations 





    Common terms 
    -------------------------------------------

        POJO - plain old java object 
            - ordinary java classes 
            - simple class 
            - a class that doesn't 
                - extend to any other class 
                - contain any annotations 
                - implement any interface 


                public class Employee {

                }

        Java Beans 
            - it is special pojo class that has below requirements 
                - implements serializable 
                - all properties / instance variables are defined as private 
                - public getter/setter methods 
                - has a no-arg constructor 

            public class Employee implements serializable {

            }

        VO - value object 


        BO - Business object 
            - classes that represent business entities 

        SO - Service object 
            - classes represents code to perform some business operations 
            - business logic 

        DAO - Data access object    
            - classes represents code to perform db operations 
            - 

        DTO - Data transfer object 
            - used to represent the structure of data usually exchanged between client-servers 


        


        Spring Beans 


   ------------------------------------------- 



    Control statements 
        - if 

            if(boolean_expression){

            }

        - if - else

                    statements;
                   
            }


    Looping statements 
        - while 
        - do while 
        - for 
        - enhanced for loop 

     



    Array 
    ---------
        - used to store fixed number of elements 
        - the size of array is fixed 
        - in java Array is an object 

        a. declare an array variable 

                <<data-type>>[] arr-var-name;
                int[] numbers;
                short[] nums;
                String[] names;
                double 

                String[] names;
                String [] names;
                String []names;
                String names[];


        b. create array object 

                arr-var-name = new <data-type>[size];
                numbers = new int[5];


        c. initialize values 

                numbers[0] = 10;
                numbers[1] = 20;
                numbers[2] = 30;


        int[] numbers = new int[5];

        int[] numbers = new int[] {21,54,34,54,76,45};




      java.util.Arrays class 
      -----------------------------
        - This class contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as sorting and searching). This class also contains a static factory that allows arrays to be viewed as lists.


    Java OOPS 
    ----------------

        Encapsulation 
            - binding data & logic together 

        Abstraction 
            - hiding the complexities from outside world 
            - hide unnecessary details from the outside world 

        Inheritance 
            - a class can be derived from another class 
            - the members of the parent class are inherited by the child class 
            - reusability 
            - maintainability 
            - extendibility 

                        class Person {
                            String name;
                            int age; 
                            Date DOB; 
                            ...
                            //
                            //

                            //
                        } 

                        class Employee extends Person {
                            int empId;
                            double salary;
                        }

        Polymorphism 
            - many forms of the same interface depending on the type of object the variable is pointint to 

            

                        class Car {
                            //
                            //
                            //
                            //
                            //
                            public void move(){
                                //
                            }
                        }

                        class BMWCar extends Car{
                            //override
                            public void move(){
                                //child specific behavior of move method
                            }
                        }

                        class MercedesCar extends Car {
                            //override
                            public void move(){
                                //child specific behavior of move method
                            }
                        }


                        Car car = null;



        Class 
        --------
            - a class is a user defined data type 
            - a class is a blueprint for objects 
            - ecapsulate data and logic together 


        Object 
        --------
            - an object is an instance of a class 
            - using 'new' keyword we can create an object of a class 


            class Customer {

                //static variable 
                //final variables 
                //instance variables 

                //constructors 

                //instance methods

                //abstract methods  
            
                //inner class 
            }

            class Product {

            }

            class Employee {

            }


    Constructor 
    -------------
        - special function / method which has the same name as the class 
        - this function is invoked only once, whenever the object of this class is created 
        - used to initialize values for instance members 
        - a class can have multiple constructors, 
            - class should have at least a no-arg constructor 
        

        this keyword 
        --------------
            - this() constructor 
                - it is used to invoke another constructor whithin the same class 
                - call this 'this()' constructor must be the first line 

            - this 
                - used to access the members of the same class 


    ========================
    Explore: 
        - private constructors and its usage 
            - https://www.baeldung.com/java-private-constructors

        - factory methods in java 
            - 

        - method overloading in java 


    ==========================




        public class Employee {

            private int empId;
            private String name;

            public Employee(){      //constructor 

            }

            public Employee(int id, int name){
                this.empId = id;
                this.name  = name;
            }

        }


    a Proper encapsulated class / tightly encapsulated class 
        - when a class has all instance variables defined as private 
            and accessible through the getter/setters only 


    Method Overloading 
    --------------------
        - a class can contain multiple methods with the same name but the parameteres should be diff 
        - compile time Polymorphism / static binding 


    Object class 
    -------------------
        - Object class is by default a super most class for all the classes in java 
        - everyclass is exclusively subclass of object class 

            Object class methods
            ---------------------
                - int hashCode()
                - boolean equals(Object o)
                - String toString() 




                                Object 
                                  |
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Student                 System          ArrayList           Scanner         ..
        Employee                                LinkedList
        CustomClass...


    Overriding the toString() method 
    ----------------------------------
        - Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object.
        - It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
        - whenever we use the ref variable in an expression, by default it calls the toString() on that object 

    Overriding the equals() method 
    -------------------------------------
        - you can override equals() method to provide logic to compare two objects of same type 
        

        **equals() contract 

        Student student = new Student();

        Object object = new Student();        //valid


    **a variable of parent class can reference to an object of clild class 



    Inheritance 
    -----------------
        - allows to create a subclass, inheriting all the non-private members of the super class 
        - using 'extends' keyword we can inherit a class from another class 
        - inheritance creates is-a relationship 

        public class Person {
            //instance variables 
        
            ..

            ..
        }

        public class Employee extends Person {

                //...

                ...

                ..

        }

                                                                        PersonalLoanAcc     HomeLoanAcc     



    Has-A relationship / Ojbect Relationships
    ----------------------------
        - objects may have relationship with each other 

        a. Composition 


        b. Aggregation 
            
            - the lifecycle of object is tied up 

                class Engine {

                }

                class Car {

                    Engine engine;
                }


        c. Association 

                public class Book {                         public class Author {
                    int bookId;                                     int authorId;
                    String title;                                   String name;
                    Author author;

                }                                           }


    class {
        instance variables
        constructor 
        instance methods 
        ...
        ..
    }


    Interface 
    --------------------
        - similar to a class, but it describes only abstract methods 
        - interface contains only 'public abstract' methods and 'public static final' variables 
        - interfaces are used to define set of requirements that a class has to implement 
        - a class must implement an interface and override the abstract methods

        interface <<InterfaceName>>{

                public static final variables;

                public abstract methods;

        }

        interface Taxable {
            public abstract void calcTax(double intRate);
        }


        class ClothingProduct implements Taxable{

            //override the abstract methods of the interface 
            public void calcTax(double intRate){
                //define the logic 
            }
        }

        Taxable product = new ClothingProduct();


        **A variable of type interface can reference to an object of its implementation class 


    Abstract classes 
    -------------------
        - abstract classes are used to act just a superclass, representing data & code to be inherited to the subclasses 
        - using 'abstract' keyword we can declare abstract class
        - we cannot instantiate abstract classes 
            - we cannot create object of abstract class 

        - if a class has 'abstract' methods, then it must be marked as abstract
            - the abstract methods of a class must be overridden by its immediate subclass 


        

        public abstract class Car {

            //instance variables 
            //static variables 

            //constructor 

            //instance methods 

            public abstract void move();

        }

        public class BMWCar extends Car {

            public BMWCar(){
                
            }

            //override the superclass methods 
            public void move(){
                sysout("BMW Car moves fast")
            }
        }


        public class MercedesCar extends Car {

            //override the superclass methods 
            public void move(){
                sysout("MercedesCar moves fast and smooth");
            }
        }

        Car car = new BMWCar();
        car.move();

        car = new MercedesCar();
        car.move();

    Method Overloading 
    ---------------------
        - writing multiple methods with same name but diff parameters inside the same class 


    Method Overriding 
    --------------------
        - redefining a super class method in the subclass using the same method signature 
        - it is used to define child specific behavior of the superclass method 
        - in method overriding, the name, parameters and return type must be same


        -Rules for method overriding 
        --------------------------------
            - 1. only the inherited methods (non-private) can be overridden 
                    Note: private and static method cannot be overridden 

                    public class A {
                       public void method(){

                       }
                    }

                    public class B extends A{

                    }

            2. the overridden method can not have restrictive access in the subclass 

                    public class A {
                       protected void method(){

                       }
                    }

                    public class B extends A{
                        public void method(){

                       }
                    }

            3. the overridden method must have the exact* method signature in the subclass 
                    Note: the return type in the overridden method can be a subtype















    Abstract Method 
    ----------------------
        - a method without definition 
        - a method declared using 'abstract' keyword 


   
   
        interface EmploeyeRepository {

            public abstract void addEmployee(Employee employee);
            
            public abstract Employee getEmployee(int empId);
            
            public abstract List<Employee> getAllEmployees();
            
            public abstract void deleteEmployee(int empId);

        }

        public class EmploeyeRepositoryImpl implements EmploeyeRepository{

            //must override all the methods of the interface
            public  void addEmployee(Employee employee){

            }

            public  List<Employee> getAllEmployees()
        }

















    Arrays are fixed length / size group of elements 


    Collection Framework 
    --------------------------
        - java.util provides various data structures called as collections
        - Collection classes offer various DS to allow creating dynamic group of objects 
        - collections are set of reusable datastructures which are used to create group of objects

    ArrayList
    ------------
        - ArrayList is one of the implementation class of List Interface 
        - used to list of objects 
        - the initial capacity of arraylist is 10

        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.add(10);
        list.add(30);
        list.add(40);
        list.add(60);
