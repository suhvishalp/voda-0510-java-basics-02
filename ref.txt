Java 
----------

    .java ----> java compiler -----------------------> .class 
                converts your javacode into ByteCode


    - ByteCode is understandable only to JVM

    JVM - Java Virtual Machine 
        - responsible to execute the bytecode on the given platform 

    JRE - Java Runtime Environment
        - JVM + standard libraries 

    JDK - Java Development Kit 
        - JRE + development tools i.e. javac, jar, etc.

        4. Data types, operators in java 

========================


    Java is a object oriented programming language 




    - Variables in java 
        - store values 

        1. Local Variables 
                - declared inside a method, constructor  
                - don't have default values, must be initialized before its use 
                - memory for all the local variables will be allocated when the method is invoked, and the detroyed when the method finishes its execution 


        2. Instance Variables 
                - declared inside a class, (outside methods)
                - whenever a new object is created (using 'new' keyword), memory for all the instance 
                    variables will be allocated, destroyed when the object is deleted 
                - instance variables have default values 
                    - i.e. for numbers = 0
                        for booleans = false 
                        for reference types = null 
                - we can use the access modifiers i.e. public, private, protected, default 

                        - defualt - the members will be accessible anywhere within the same 'package'
                        - public - accessible everywhere 
                        - private - accessible only within the class 
                        - protected - accessible only within the class and the subclass 

        3. Static Variables 
                - declared inside a class, using the 'static' keyword
                - only 1 copy of static variable will be allocated per class 
                - when the class is loaded, memory for static variables will be allocated 
                - define the accessiblity using the modifiers i.e. public, private, protected 


Garbadge Collection 
    - removes the unreferenced objects from the memory 


    static keyword 
        - static variables 

        - static methods 

        - static class 

    final keyword 
        - final variables
            - a final variable is constant variables, once the value is assigned you cannot change it  

        - final methods 
            - a final method cannot be overridden in its subclass 

        - final class 
            - a final class cannot be subclassed 


    Java Keyboard inputs 
    ------------------------

            1. using Scanner class 

            2. using IO classes 

            3. using Console class 



    Data types 
    ----------------
        primitive data types 
            - hold / represent values directly 

                byte        1 byte              -128 to 127

                short       2 bytes             ..

                int         4 bytes             ..

                long        8 bytes 

                float       4 bytes 

                double      8 bytes 

                char        1 byte 

                boolean     1 bit

        Refernece types 
            - all the class, interface, enums type variables are called reference types 
            - stores ref to the memory 

                String str; 
                Employee employee;


        Wrapper classes 
        --------------------
            - for each primitive type i.e. int, char etc. there is a corresponding reference type available i.e. Integer, Character 


                    byte                Byte 
                    short               Short 
                    int                 Integer 
                    long                Long 
                    float               Float 
                    double              Double 
                    char                Character 
                    boolean             Boolean 

            - wrapper classes provide various methods to perform typecasting, and a few operations 





    Common terms 
    -------------------------------------------

        POJO - plain old java object 
            - ordinary java classes 
            - simple class 
            - a class that doesn't 
                - extend to any other class 
                - contain any annotations 
                - implement any interface 


                public class Employee {

                }

        Java Beans 
            - it is special pojo class that has below requirements 
                - implements serializable 
                - all properties / instance variables are defined as private 
                - public getter/setter methods 
                - has a no-arg constructor 

            public class Employee implements serializable {

            }

        VO - value object 


        BO - Business object 
            - classes that represent business entities 

        SO - Service object 
            - classes represents code to perform some business operations 
            - business logic 

        DAO - Data access object    
            - classes represents code to perform db operations 
            - 

        DTO - Data transfer object 
            - used to represent the structure of data usually exchanged between client-servers 


        


        Spring Beans 


   ------------------------------------------- 



    Control statements 
        - if 

            if(boolean_expression){

            }

        - if - else

                    statements;
                   
            }


    Looping statements 
        - while 
        - do while 
        - for 
        - enhanced for loop 

     



    Array 
    ---------
        - used to store fixed number of elements 
        - the size of array is fixed 
        - in java Array is an object 

        a. declare an array variable 

                <<data-type>>[] arr-var-name;
                int[] numbers;
                short[] nums;
                String[] names;
                double 

                String[] names;
                String [] names;
                String []names;
                String names[];


        b. create array object 

                arr-var-name = new <data-type>[size];
                numbers = new int[5];


        c. initialize values 

                numbers[0] = 10;
                numbers[1] = 20;
                numbers[2] = 30;


        int[] numbers = new int[5];

        int[] numbers = new int[] {21,54,34,54,76,45};




      java.util.Arrays class 
      -----------------------------
        - This class contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as sorting and searching). This class also contains a static factory that allows arrays to be viewed as lists.


    Java OOPS 
    ----------------

        Encapsulation 
            - binding data & logic together 

        Abstraction 
            - hiding the complexities from outside world 
            - hide unnecessary details from the outside world 

        Inheritance 
            - a class can be derived from another class 
            - the members of the parent class are inherited by the child class 
            - reusability 
            - maintainability 
            - extendibility 

                        class Person {
                            String name;
                            int age; 
                            Date DOB; 
                            ...
                            //
                            //

                            //
                        } 

                        class Employee extends Person {
                            int empId;
                            double salary;
                        }

        Polymorphism 
            - many forms of the same interface depending on the type of object the variable is pointint to 

            

                        class Car {
                            //
                            //
                            //
                            //
                            //
                            public void move(){
                                //
                            }
                        }

                        class BMWCar extends Car{
                            //override
                            public void move(){
                                //child specific behavior of move method
                            }
                        }

                        class MercedesCar extends Car {
                            //override
                            public void move(){
                                //child specific behavior of move method
                            }
                        }


                        Car car = null;



        Class 
        --------
            - a class is a user defined data type 
            - a class is a blueprint for objects 
            - ecapsulate data and logic together 


        Object 
        --------
            - an object is an instance of a class 
            - using 'new' keyword we can create an object of a class 


            class Customer {

                //static variable 
                //final variables 
                //instance variables 

                //constructors 

                //instance methods

                //abstract methods  
            
                //inner class 
            }

            class Product {

            }

            class Employee {

            }


    Constructor 
    -------------
        - special function / method which has the same name as the class 
        - this function is invoked only once, whenever the object of this class is created 
        - used to initialize values for instance members 
        - a class can have multiple constructors, 
            - class should have at least a no-arg constructor 
        

        this keyword 
        --------------
            - this() constructor 
                - it is used to invoke another constructor whithin the same class 
                - call this 'this()' constructor must be the first line 

            - this 
                - used to access the members of the same class 


    ========================
    Explore: 
        - private constructors and its usage 
            - https://www.baeldung.com/java-private-constructors

        - factory methods in java 
            - 

        - method overloading in java 


    ==========================




        public class Employee {

            private int empId;
            private String name;

            public Employee(){      //constructor 

            }

            public Employee(int id, int name){
                this.empId = id;
                this.name  = name;
            }

        }


    a Proper encapsulated class / tightly encapsulated class 
        - when a class has all instance variables defined as private 
            and accessible through the getter/setters only 


    Method Overloading 
    --------------------
        - a class can contain multiple methods with the same name but the parameteres should be diff 
        - compile time Polymorphism / static binding 


    Object class 
    -------------------
        - Object class is by default a super most class for all the classes in java 
        - everyclass is exclusively subclass of object class 

            Object class methods
            ---------------------
                - int hashCode()
                - boolean equals(Object o)
                - String toString() 




                                Object 
                                  |
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Student                 System          ArrayList           Scanner         ..
        Employee                                LinkedList
        CustomClass...


    Overriding the toString() method 
    ----------------------------------
        - Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object.
        - It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
        - whenever we use the ref variable in an expression, by default it calls the toString() on that object 

    Overriding the equals() method 
    -------------------------------------
        - you can override equals() method to provide logic to compare two objects of same type 
        

        **equals() contract 

        Student student = new Student();

        Object object = new Student();        //valid


    **a variable of parent class can reference to an object of clild class 



    Inheritance 
    -----------------
        - allows to create a subclass, inheriting all the non-private members of the super class 
        - using 'extends' keyword we can inherit a class from another class 
        - inheritance creates is-a relationship 

        public class Person {
            //instance variables 
        
            ..

            ..
        }

        public class Employee extends Person {

                //...

                ...

                ..

        }

    Has-A relationship / Ojbect Relationships
    ----------------------------
        - objects may have relationship with each other 

        a. Composition 


        b. Aggregation 
            
            - the lifecycle of object is tied up 

                class Engine {

                }

                class Car {

                    Engine engine;
                }


        c. Association 

                public class Book {                         public class Author {
                    int bookId;                                     int authorId;
                    String title;                                   String name;
                    Author author;

                }                                           }


    class {
        instance variables
        constructor 
        instance methods 
        ...
        ..
    }


    Interface 
    --------------------
        - similar to a class, but it describes only abstract methods 
        - interface contains only 'public abstract' methods and 'public static final' variables 
        - interfaces are used to define set of requirements that a class has to implement 
        - a class must implement an interface and override the abstract methods
        **- an interface can extend from several interfaces

        interface <<InterfaceName>>{

                public static final variables;

                public abstract methods;

        }

        interface Taxable {
            public abstract void calcTax(double intRate);
        }


        class ClothingProduct implements Taxable, AnotherInterface{

            //override the abstract methods of the interface 
            public void calcTax(double intRate){
                //define the logic 
            }
        }

        Taxable product = new ClothingProduct();


        **A variable of type interface can reference to an object of its implementation class 


    Abstract classes 
    -------------------
        - abstract classes are used to act just a superclass, representing data & code to be inherited to the subclasses 
        - using 'abstract' keyword we can declare abstract class
        - we cannot instantiate abstract classes 
            - we cannot create object of abstract class 

        - if a class has 'abstract' methods, then it must be marked as abstract
            - the abstract methods of a class must be overridden by its immediate subclass 


        

        public abstract class Car {

            //instance variables 
            //static variables 

            //constructor 

            //instance methods 

            public abstract void move();

        }

        public class BMWCar extends Car {

            public BMWCar(){
                
            }

            //override the superclass methods 
            public void move(){
                sysout("BMW Car moves fast")
            }
        }


        public class MercedesCar extends Car {

            //override the superclass methods 
            public void move(){
                sysout("MercedesCar moves fast and smooth");
            }
        }

        Car car = new BMWCar();
        car.move();

        car = new MercedesCar();
        car.move();

    Method Overloading 
    ---------------------
        - writing multiple methods with same name but diff parameters inside the same class 


    Method Overriding 
    --------------------
        - redefining a super class method in the subclass using the same method signature 
        - it is used to define child specific behavior of the superclass method 
        - in method overriding, the name, parameters and return type must be same


        -Rules for method overriding 
        --------------------------------
            - 1. only the inherited methods (non-private) can be overridden 
                    Note: private and static method cannot be overridden 

                    public class A {
                       public void method(){

                       }
                    }

                    public class B extends A{

                    }

            2. the overridden method can not have restrictive access in the subclass 

                    public class A {
                       protected void method(){

                       }
                    }

                    public class B extends A{
                        public void method(){

                       }
                    }

            3. the overridden method must have the exact* method signature in the subclass 
                    Note: the return type in the overridden method can be a subtype


    Abstract Method 
    ----------------------
        - a method without definition 
        - a method declared using 'abstract' keyword 


     ..


   
   
        interface EmploeyeRepository {

            public abstract void addEmployee(Employee employee);
            
            public abstract Employee getEmployee(int empId);
            
            public abstract List<Employee> getAllEmployees();
            
            public abstract void deleteEmployee(int empId);

        }

        public class EmploeyeRepositoryImpl implements EmploeyeRepository{

            //must override all the methods of the interface
            public  void addEmployee(Employee employee){

            }

            public  List<Employee> getAllEmployees()
        }

















    Arrays are fixed length / size group of elements 


    Collection Framework 
    --------------------------
        - java.util provides various data structures called as collections
        - Collection classes offer various DS to allow creating dynamic group of objects 
        - collections are set of dynamic and reusable datastructures which are used to create group of objects 

                    Iterable<E> interface

   Collection<T> interface
    - this is the supermost interface in the collection hierarchy that describes few common methods 
    - ie.                |-> boolean add(E e)
                         |-> boolean	addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
                         |-> void	clear()
                         |-> boolean	contains(Object o)
                         |-> boolean	remove(Object o)

    List<E> Interface 
    ------------------
        - models an indexed collection of elements, it allows duplicate elements 
        - List Implementation classes are ...
            1. ArrayList<E> 
                - internally uses "resizable array" as a datastructure 
                - the initial capacity of arraylist is 10
                - not synchronized

            2. LinkedList<E> 
                - internally uses "double linked list" as a datastructure 
                - the initial capacity is 0
                - good for lists that require freqent insertions, deletions

            3. Vector<E> 
              - internally uses resizable array as a datastructure 
              - the initial capacity of arraylist is 10
              - vector is synchronized, so it is thread safe

            4. Stack<E>
              - internally uses resizable array as a datastructure 
              - offers LIFO approach   


    Set<E> Interface 
    ---------------------
        - Set interface models a collection of object that doesn't allow duplicate elements 
        - whenever we add a new element, it first compares the element with all objects (using their equals() and hashCode() ) in the set, 
            if it doesn't exisit then only the new element will be added 
        - Note: if you create a set of custom objects, make sure you implement the hashCode() and equals() methods correctly 
        - Set Implementation classes -- 

            1. HashSet<E> 
                - doesn't guarantee order of insertion 
                - internally uses 'HashTable' structure 

            2. LinkedHashSet<E> 
                - stores elements as per the insertion order 
                - uses 'HashTable+double linked list' data strcuture 
            
            3. TreeSet<E> 
                - maintains the sorted order of elements 
                - uses 'balanced tree' data structure 


     Queue<E> Interface 
     ---------------------
        - FIFO approach 
        - it models a collection in the form of a queue that has FIFO approach 

                |       |       |       |       |       |       |



    hashCode()
        - its an integer number represening the object; 
        - The default implementation of the hashCode method is provided by the Object class, 
                which returns a unique integer value for each object based on its memory address.


    equals() and hashCode() contract 
    -----------------------------------
        - if two objects are equal to each other based on equals() method, 
                then the hash code must be the same
        - unequal objects may have the same hashCode


    Natural Ordering 
    ---------------------
        - natural ordering is the default ordering of elements while sorting in array / collection 
        - if you create a collection of custom objects, and want them sorted, then you must define 
            the natural ordering of the elements 

        - using below two interfaces we can define natural ordering of custom objects 
        - 1.  interface Comparable

                    interface Comparable<E> {
                        int compareTo(E obj);
                    }

                    class Student implemets Comparable<Student> {
                        //
                        //
                        int marks;

                        public int compareTo(Student otherStudent){
                            
                            //return a compare value
                            if(this.marks > otherStudent.marks)
                                return 1;
                            else if (this.marks == otherStudent.marks)
                                return 0;
                            else 
                                return -1;
                        }
                    }

        - 2.  interface Comparator
                - this is used to create external comparators 


                public class StudentNameComparator implements Comparator<Student>{

                    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2){
                            //logic to return a compare value
                    }
                }
    

    **Compare Value 
        - its an integer number 

            
            e1.compareTo(e2)
            if first object is > second object         : return 1 or positive number 
            if first object is < second object         : return -1 or negative number 
            if both are equal                          : return 0


   
    Create a list 
    ------------------

        - non-generic list 

            ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
            List list = new ArrayList();
            List list =  new LinkedList();

        - generic list 

            ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
            List<String> listNames = new ArrayList<>();

            List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();



    Create a Set

            Set set = new HashSet();
            Set<Integer> set = new HashSet();










     List list = new ArrayLists()
     ArrayList list = new ArrayList();


    ArrayList
    ------------
        - ArrayList is one of the implementation class of List Interface 
        - used to list of objects 
        - the initial capacity of arraylist is 10

        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.add(10);
        list.add(30);
        list.add(40);
        list.add(60);





    Enumerator, Iterator, ListIterator  
    -------------------------------------
        Iterator 
            - common object for iterating over any type of collection i.e list, set, queue etc. 
            - allows to iterate collection only in forward direction 

        ListIterator 
            - specific to Lists, used to iterator over lists 
            - has next() and previous() methods, which allow to iterate in both directions 

        
        Enumeration 
            - this is also used to iterate over collection 
            - Collections.enumeration(collection) creates the enumerator 



        Queue<E> Interface methods 
        -----------------------------

            insert the element                  add(E e)                    offer(E e)

            remove the element                  remove()                    poll()

            inspect / fetch the element         element()                   peek()


        Deque<E> Interface 
            - represents a double headed queue 

            insert the element                  add(E e)                    offer(E e)
                                                addFirst(E e)               offerFirst(E e)

            remove the element                  remove()                    poll()
                                                removeFirst()               pollFirst()

            inspect / fetch the element         element()                   peek()
                                                peekFirst()                 peekLast()


       BlockingQueue<E> Interface methods 
        -----------------------------

            insert the element                  add(E e)                    offer(E e)          put(E e)

            remove the element                  remove()                    poll()              take()

            inspect / fetch the element         element()                   peek()


        
        Map<K, V> Interface 
        --------------------
            - models a collection of elements of objects in the form of key-value pairs 
            - the key can be of any type, the value also can be of any type 
            - cannot have duplicate key, all the keys should be unique 

            - Map implementation classes are... 

                1. HashTable<K,V>
                        - doesn't allow null key 
                        - synchronized

                2. HashMap<K,V>
                        - allows one null key 
                        - not synchronized

                3. LinkedHashMap<K,V> 
                        - maintains order of insertion by keys 
                
                4. TreeMap<K,V>
                        - maintains sorted order of keys based on their natural ordering 


            Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>()
            Map<Integer, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>()
            Map<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>()


        Iterate over a Map 
        -----------------------

                Collection<T> values()

                Set<K> keySet();

                entrySet()


    Exception Handling 
    ----------------------
        - exception is an abnormal event that might occur during the program execution 


            - Compile time errors 
                    - invalid code syntax 
                    - invalid variables 
                    - incomplete types 
                    - misspelling 

            - Expcetion
                - abnormal event that occurs at run time 
                    i.e. input is invalid, code logic is incorrect, file/db connection fails, dependencies fails etc. 


            - Java allows to handle such exceptions and do the needful as corrective steps 

            - to handle the exception 
                1. find the problem - hit the exception 
                2. inform that the problem has occured - throw the exception
                3. receive the information about the problem - catch the exception 
                4. take corrective actions - handle the exception  

        Exception class hierarchy
        ------------------------------

                    Throwable 
                       |
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        Exception                                                   Error 
            |                                                        |
            |->represents the issues occured at run-time             |-> represents internal system errors (Memory errors, virtual machine error)
            |                                                        |-> LinkageError
            |
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RuntimeException                IOExeption          SQLException        EmployeeNotFoundException
      |
    ArithmaticException
    InputMismatchException
    ArrayIndexOutofBoundExpception 
    NullPointerException 
    IllegalStateException 


    ** Default exception handler 
        - If run-time system searches all the methods on call stack and couldn’t have find the appropriate handler 
            then run-time system handover the Exception Object to default exception handler, which is part of run-time system.
            This default handler prints exception class name, exception description and stacktrace and terminates program abnormally.


    Unchecked Expcetions 
        - not necessarily handled by try-catch block 
        - if there is no handler found, these exception are handled by the "default exception handler"
        - all the "RunTimeExceptions" are unchecked 

    Checked Expceptions 
        - must be handled by writing try-catch block or they can be declared to be thrown


        Below concepts are used to handle the exception 
        --------------------------------------------------
            - try-catch block
            - 'throws' keyword 
            - 'throw' keyword 
            - 'finally' keyword 
            - try with resources block (introduced in java7)
                - you can use try with resource block only for 'Closable' resources 
            - creating custom exception classes 



                try {
                    //make a connection to the db 

                    //perform some db related oprations here..
                    //the code to be monitored 

                   

                }catch(XYZException ex){

                }catch(PQRException ex){

                }finally{
                     //once the operations are done, close the connection
                     //release the resources 
                }



                try(open the connection to db / file / etc){

                }catch(Exception ex){

                }





    Multi Threading 
    ----------------
        - every java program runs inside a thread, i.e. Main Thread 

        There are three ways to create a thread 

        1. using the Thread class 
            a.  create a custom class that extends the Thread class 

                    class MyThread extends Thread {

                    }

            b. override the 'run()' method to define the task you want to execute in the thread 

                    class MyThread extends Thread {

                        public void run(){
                            //code to be executed inside a thread.
                        }
                    }     
            c. start the thread 
                 calling the 'start()' method on the thread object       

        2. using the Runnable interface 

            a. create a class that implements Runnable interface & override the 'run()' method to define the task you want to execute in the thread 
                - this class just represents the code that is supposed to be executed inside a thread 

                    class MyTask implements Runnable {
                        public void run(){
                            //code to be executed inside a thread.
                        }
                    }

            b. Create a Thread Object, initialize the runnable task and start the tread 
                    MyTask task1 = new MyTask();
                    Thread t1 = new Thread(task1);





        How to pause a thrad 
            - Thread.sleep() method 

        How to interrupt a thread 
            - Thread.interupt(); 

        how to make a thread wait for another thread 
            - .join() method 


        Thread synchronization 
        --------------------------
            - implement synchronization
                = 1. using the ReentrantLock object (old technique)
                = 2. making the methods synchronized


        Thread DeadLock 
        ----------

            class A {

                synchronized void methodA() {
                    B.methoB()
                }
            }


            class B {
               synchronized void methodB() {
                    A.methodA();
                } 
            }

        3. Creating threads and executing multiple tasks using "Concurrent API" 

                   1. java.util.concurrent package 
                        **- provides the utility classes commonly useful in concurrent programming 
                            i.e. Executors 

                   2. java.util.concurrent.locks package 
                        - provides Lock and Condition implementations 

                   3. java.util.concurrent.atomic package  
                        - provides some data types i.e. AtomicInteger 



            java.util.concurrent
            ---------------------------
                    - provides utility classes that are used to create "thread pools" 
                    - instead of creating a new thread whenever a task arrives / every time, 
                            you can use a thread pool which keeps a number of reusable threads ready for executing the task 
                    - the "Executors" provides various methods to create a pool of threads 

                    1. Executor 

                    2. ExecutorService 

                    3. ScheduledExecutorService 



                methods to create thread pools 
                -------------------------------
                    1. newSingleThreadExecutor()
                    2. newFixedThreadPool(0)



            <T> Future<T>	submit(Callable<T> task)
                - Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task


        Future interface: 
        -------------------
            - it is an interface, 
            - A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation 

                    interface Future<V>{
                        V	get()
                            // Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.
                        V	get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
                            //Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.
                    }

        Callable interface 
        ------------------
            - public interface Callable<V>
                    - A task that returns a result and may throw an exception
                    - override the V call() method 

        //class B represents a Callable task - a task that can be executed inside a thread, and it may return a value or throw exception
        class B implements Callable<V> {
                //override 
                public V call(){
                    //perfom some async task 
                    //calculate some values
                    return a value V;
                }
        }

        B taskB = new B();



        //class A represents a runnable task - a task that can be executed inside a thread 
        class A implements Runnable {
                //override 
                public void run(){

                }
        }

        ExecutorService poolService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        poolService.execute(Runnable target)
        poolService.submit(Callable target)

        Future<V> futValue =  poolService.submit(taskB);          //internaly this method uses a thread from the pool, and executes the taskB
        V value  = futValue.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        V value  = futValue.get();






                        Executor<T> interface 
                            |
                            |-> void execute(Runnable target)

        JDBC 
        ------------
            - java database connectivity 
            - jdbc is just a specification or standard that every db vendor has to implement 
            - every DB Vendor generally provides "driver" to communicate with the database 
            - to use the MySQL Database you have to first download the 'mysql-sql-driver'


            - Driver class 
                - responsible to communiate with the respective database 


            db                          Driver class name                   url 
            mysql                       com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver            jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
            oracle                          
            ms sql server 
            h2 
            ..
            ..


            DriverManager class 
                - used to create the "Connection" with the database 

            Connection object 
                - Connection object represents the connection to the db and used to send sql commands to the databse 

            Statement Object 
                - using the Connection object, we can create 'Statement' objects 
                - using the 'statement' object we can submit the sql commands / sql queries to the db 

                    1. Statement 
                            connection.createStatement()

                    2. PreparedStatement 
                            connection.prepareStatement()

                    3. Callable Statement 
                            connection.callStatement();



        Steps to connect / communicate with the database 

            1. load the db drivers 

                        Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

            2. create Connection with the db 

                      Connection connection =  DriverManager.getConnection("urlOfTheDb","username","password");

            3. create the Statement object 

                          Statement statement =  connection.createStatement();

            4. execute the sql commands / submit the sql queries to the db 

                            int executeUpdate(String query)
                                - submits the sql statement to the db, and returns an int value that represents the number of rows affected 
                                - used to INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE 

                            statement.executeResult()

                            statement.execute();

            5. close the connection 

                    connection.close();
